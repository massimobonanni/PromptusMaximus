# 🏛️ Promptus Maximus

**Speak like Caesar. Complain like Cicero. Debug like a gladiator.**

Welcome to **Promptus Maximus**, the most unnecessarily dramatic language demo this side of the Rubicon. Powered by GitHub-hosted LLMs and fueled by fake Latin, this app takes your mundane modern phrases and reimagines them as epic proclamations worthy of the Roman Senate.

## 🤔 What Is This?

Promptus Maximus is a satirical translation engine that turns everyday expressions into theatrical, Latin-inspired nonsense. Whether you're stuck in traffic or rage-pushing to `main`, our LLMs will elevate your suffering to imperial poetry.

> “My code won’t compile.”  
> → *By Jupiter’s beard! The sacred scrolls of logic refuse to obey—debuggus maximus is upon us!*

## 🧠 How It Works

- You input a modern phrase (e.g., “I need coffee”).
- The LLM channels its inner Roman philosopher, senator, or gladiator.
- You receive a gloriously exaggerated pseudo-Latin reinterpretation.
- You laugh. Or cry. Or both.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- GitHub-hosted LLMs (because open source is the new Empire)
- Prompt engineering with theatrical flair
- Optional mascot personalities (DevDuck the Scriba, CoderFox the Centurion)
- Zero actual Latin knowledge required

## 🐔 Mascot Mode (Optional but Highly Recommended)

Enable **Mascot Mode** to let DevDuck and CoderFox deliver translations in character:
- 🦆 *DevDuck*: A neurotic Roman scribe with caffeine dependency
- 🦊 *CoderFox*: A battle-hardened centurion who commits with honor
